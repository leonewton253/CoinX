CoinX
=====

An alternative Bitcoin Client utilizing a distributed Exchange and Communication platform. The platform will be similar to localbitcoins.com site, but with a slight twist. The client will verify funds in both USD and BTC, the BTC stored locally on your computer. 

The program will have to login to your Banks website to verify funds. It will obviously be important to use a separate account just for Bitcoin cash deposits, that's completely separate from your main personal accounts.

The goal of the application will to be a platform that is both secure and decentralized, preventing it from being shutdown. The only way to fully dismantle it would require a warrant to freeze all accounts associated with the exchange.

Like Mt. Gox, trades will be automated.

Features:
- Automated trades
- USD Verification
- Secure communication through Tor (Like TorChat)
- Decentralized P2P trades and Communication
- Printable Wallet
- Backup Wallet to services like Drive, Drop Box, etc. or Brain Wallet passphrase
